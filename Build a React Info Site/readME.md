## Description
The first project from Bob Ziroll's learn-react course was to build a static page with React.

It is deployed on Netlify & is live at this link: https://celadon-strudel-9da499.netlify.app/

Building this static page has given me the confidence to take on the solo-project which is to build a digital-business-card.
When I complete the solo project it will also be deployed on Netlify and in this readME.
