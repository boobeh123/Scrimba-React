Mini Challenge:
Move the `header` element from Page into 
its own component called "Header"

Extra credit: Render both components

/**
Main Challenge: 

- Move the `footer` into its own component called "Footer" 
  and render that component inside the Page component. (Note from me: I rendered the components within my App component.)
- Move the `h1` and `ol` together into another component
  called "MainContent" and render inside Page as well.
