/*
Challenge: Think critically - how would you pass in a prop that wasn't
a string datatype.

E.g. Say you want each Joke component to receive an "upvotes" and "downvotes"
prop that is a number, as well as a prop with an array of comments, and a boolean
of whether the joke is a pun (`isPun`).

// Note from me: Since this was more of a "how do you do this" challenge, I only included the code for my local environment. Code will work if cloned & launched.
