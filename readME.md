## Description
I read the official React documentation, coded along to a TraversyMedia React crash course, and went back to learn more React fundamentals with EggHead's React course.

Despite learning from these 3 resources I was not able to update my own projects into React or build new projects with React.

I am now building projects from this course as a way to deepen my understanding of React and gain confidence to update my projects into React.

## Summary of lesson 1 of 4
The first couple of projects from Bob Ziroll's learn-react course is to build a static page with React.
